# Padded Square-and-Multiply

A toy square-and-multiply implementation that has constant cycles, but leaks when looking at the number of retired instructions. 
As only a single measurement is performed the timing can be unstable (especially on the U74). 

# Run 
Run `make` then `./main`

# Works on
C906, U74
