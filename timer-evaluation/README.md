# Timer precision evaluation script
Evaluates all availiable timers present on the RISC-V system. 

# Run code
To run the main timer benchmark simply run `make; ./main` this should print a table simmilar to the one below.
To check the timer increment run `make; ./timer-resulution` which should give the timer increments for each counter.
